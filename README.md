# DataOps
**DataOps for Government**
A running list list of DataOps principles for Governments:

*Everyone* involved in the data pipeline must know how data are being used within the organization. The person collecting/entering data must know that it is being aggregated/analyzed down the road; why & for what purpose

Data must be re-usable, easily

Everyone is equally valuable – You can’t make that fancy dashboard without quality data

Data/Analytics is a *process* not a product, DataOps must focus on process-thinking aimed at achieving continuous improvement both in terms of data quality, but also analytics quality; ultimately leading to organizational/functional improvements and outcomes

Frequent, face-to-face communication is a requirement

Deliver simple, incremental insight – Don’t set out to develop a dashboard or reproduce a report. Answer simple questions first, then build on those. i.e How many inspections to we have this week? What are the most common violations? 

Use existing tools first – There’s no need to purchase software/special tools until you’ve determined how they add value to your data analytics process

Frequent reflection and feedback, to all team members’ is critical. Be positive when things go well, be constructive when things need improvement
