## Simple tests to validate and discover data quality issues

### Generate Counts:
Basic counts of data rarely provide insight, but counts often correlate to population numbers. For instance, the number of cases in a database should correlate to the population. In essence, jurisdictions with higher populations  are likely to have a similarly high number of cases. If your counts don’t meet expectations, investigate the issue…non standard data entry, capitalization issues, etc
