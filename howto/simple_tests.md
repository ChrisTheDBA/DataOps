## Simple tests to validate and discover data quality issues

### Generate Counts:
Basic counts of data rarely provide insight, but counts often correlate to population numbers. For instance, the number of cases in a database should correlate to the population. In essence, jurisdictions with higher populations  are likely to have a similarly high number of cases. If your counts don’t meet expectations, investigate the issue…non standard data entry, capitalization issues, etc
 
### Create a time series or timeline chart:
Dates are a common data quality issue that can inhibit one's ability to analyze and understand data. Generating a time series or timeline with your data will indeitify outliers that ultimately may skew your results. In general, dates should adhere to the same timeframe in which the data are collected. dates that are incirrectly formatted or have data entry errors should be readily apparent when creating a time series chart.
